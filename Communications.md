# Best Practices for Bioinformatics Students

## University Of Adelaide - Bioinformatics Hub

Last Revised 02-Feb-2017

# Communication 

- **Organise regular meetings with your supervisors:**
	- It is your responsibility to keep yourself on track
	- If you have external supervisors, remember to keep in regular contact and ask questions
- **All communication about your project to external supervisors should involve everyone involved:**
	- Everyone involved on the project should be cc'd on email communication
	- If everyone is on slack, create a direct message with everyone attached.
- **Get involved:**
	- Students around Australia are working on similar projects
	- [COMBINE group for Australian Bioinformatics Students](https://combine.org.au)
	- ABACBS/COMBINE conference will be in Adelaide in November 2017, so help out if you can
	- Bioinformatics Hub & EpiCSA social media accounts

# Working Hours & Access
